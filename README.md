# HM2
Second major project for my Introduction to Computing course.  
Topics of Focus: Conditionals, Loops  
Grade: 6.5/11  
  
NOTE: At the time of writing this program, the application of C++ concepts was very limited due to the assignment criteria. However, I plan to update this program with more efficient structures and functions on my own time. Therefore, expect changes soon!
